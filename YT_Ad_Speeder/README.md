# YTvidSpeedup
Video speedup works simply by setting the playbackRate value of the YouTube video to the maximum value (16.0).\
Speeds up ads too, so can function as a manual YouTube 'adblocker'.\
Once an ad (or video) ends, YouTube plays the subsequent ad or video in a new video element, so playbackRate gets set back to the default value (1.0) automatically.
